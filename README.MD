With permission from the original author, I made this simple port for [Kris's Compendium of Trade Goods](https://github.com/kristkos/KCTG-5e) to work with [Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/a5e)

## Requirements
The original module [Kris's Compendium of Trade Goods](https://github.com/kristkos/KCTG-5e) **is required** to load all the images. It does not have to be activated in your world but **installed**.
